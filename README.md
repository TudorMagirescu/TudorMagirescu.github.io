Behavioural tracking
  - This feature is added for the custom-javascript-validation and regex-validation only.
  - The script for tracking user's data is located in js/events.js
  - The number of mouse clicks is counted as clicks anywhere in the signup page
  - The number of characters typed is interpreted as the number of times the users types any character in the form, not just the final state.
  - The number of key presses is counted only in the form fields.
